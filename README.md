# Verma Moores Impact Site (GitHub Pages / Jekyll)

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repo (recommended name: `rakesh-verma-moores`).
2. Copy the contents of this folder into the repo root.
3. In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` / `(root)`
4. Wait for Pages to build; the site will appear at:
   `https://<username>.github.io/rakesh-verma-moores/`

## Editing
- The site is written in Markdown (Jekyll will render it) **and** HTML counterparts are included in `/html/`.
- If you prefer pure HTML, you can disable Jekyll and serve `/html/` as static pages instead.

## Consistency notes
- Keep claims consistent with the Moores PDFs (funding totals, years, roles, awards).
- Avoid adding new quantitative claims unless they also appear in the nomination packet.
