## Research and Scholarly Impact

My research emphasizes **durable, methodologically rigorous contributions** spanning:

- **Formal methods and term rewriting systems**
- **Phishing and deception detection**
- **Adversarial text and robust NLP for security**
- **Data quality, benchmarking, and evaluation for security analytics**

## Selected contributions (high level)
- A coherent line of work on core properties of rewrite systems (e.g., **confluence**, **uniqueness of normal forms**, **reachability**), including resolving recognized open problems in the rewriting community (e.g., RTA Loop Problem #63; paper commonly cited as **GTV04**).
- Early and influential work on natural-language–based phishing detection (e.g., ESORICS 2012).
- Rigorous benchmarking and evaluation of phishing detection methods for operational security needs (IEEE Access 2020).
- Recent advances in adversarial text detection for security-critical NLP systems (AAAI 2026).
- Data quality and evaluation work for analytics-driven security systems (ACM CCS 2019; IDA 2024–2025).

## Representative publications and book
- **ESORICS 2012** — “Detecting Phishing Emails the Natural Language Way”
- **ACM CCS 2019** — data quality / evaluation for security analytics
- **IEEE Access 2020** — “An In-Depth Benchmarking and Evaluation of Phishing Detection Research for Security Needs” (El Aassal, Baki, Das, Verma)
- **AAAI 2026** — adversarial text detection (accepted)
- **Book** — *Cybersecurity Analytics* (CRC Press, 2019)

## Research support and recognition
- Competitive external funding exceeding **$19M** total (with > **$12M** attributed to UH).
- **Fulbright Distinguished** appointment.
- **ACM Distinguished Speaker**.
- **ONR-funded sabbatical**.
