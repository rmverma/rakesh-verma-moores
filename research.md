## Research and Scholarly Impact

My research emphasizes **durable, methodologically rigorous contributions** spanning:

- **Formal methods and term rewriting systems**
- **Phishing and deception detection**
- **Adversarial text and robust NLP for security**
- **Data quality, benchmarking, and evaluation for security analytics**

## Selected contributions (high level)
> **Selected Contributions at a Glance**
> - Resolution of a recognized open problem in term rewriting systems (GTV04; RTA Loop #63)
> - “Problems listed in the RTA Loop archive are curated by the community precisely because they resist resolution using existing techniques.”
> - Early natural-language–based phishing detection (ESORICS 2012)
> - Benchmarking framework for phishing detection research (IEEE Access 2020)
> - Data-quality–driven security analytics (ACM CCS 2019; IDA 2024–2025)
> - Adversarial text detection for security-critical NLP systems (AAAI 2026)

- A coherent line of work on core properties of rewrite systems (e.g., **confluence**, **uniqueness of normal forms**, **reachability**), including resolving recognized open problems in the rewriting community (e.g., RTA Loop Problem #63; paper commonly cited as **GTV04**).
- Early and influential work on natural-language–based phishing detection (e.g., ESORICS 2012).
- Rigorous benchmarking and evaluation of phishing detection methods for operational security needs (IEEE Access 2020).
- Recent advances in adversarial text detection for security-critical NLP systems (AAAI 2026).
- Data quality and evaluation work for analytics-driven security systems (ACM CCS 2019; IDA 2024–2025).

## Impact Evidence and Research Artifacts

### Resolution of Recognized Open Problems (Formal Methods)

A distinguishing aspect of my work in **term rewriting systems** is the resolution of **recognized open problems** that had remained open despite sustained community attention.

- The paper commonly cited as **GTV04** resolved a long-standing open problem concerning fundamental properties of rewrite systems (including confluence and reachability), listed as **Problem #63** in the RTA Loop open problems archive.
- Contributions of this nature represent durable theoretical impact, as they address questions that structure subsequent work in automated reasoning and formal methods.

These results continue to be referenced by researchers working on the foundations of computation and rewriting theory.

### Datasets, Benchmarks, and Evaluation Infrastructure (Cybersecurity)

In cybersecurity and security analytics, my work has emphasized not only new detection methods but also **evaluation rigor, data quality, and reproducibility**.

- Development and use of **phishing and deception datasets** to support comparative evaluation of detection methods.
- Introduction of **benchmarking frameworks** that enable systematic, security-relevant evaluation of phishing detection techniques (IEEE Access 2020).
- Data-quality–driven analyses that clarify the limits and assumptions of analytics-based security systems (ACM CCS 2019; IDA 2024–2025).

These efforts have helped shape evaluation norms in analytics-driven cybersecurity research and supported follow-on work by other research groups.

### Translation and Broader Impact

Across these research areas, a consistent theme is **translation from theory to practice**:

- Formal results inform reasoning systems and verification research.
- Natural-language–based phishing detection (ESORICS 2012) contributed to the shift toward content-aware security defenses.
- Adversarial text and data-quality studies align with broader concerns about **trustworthy AI** and **robust deployment** of machine learning systems.

In parallel, student researchers trained through these projects have transitioned into **government and national-security–relevant roles**, extending the impact of this work beyond academia.
