## Service and Professional Leadership

## National and international service
- Long-term leadership of the **ACM International Workshop on Security and Privacy Analytics (IWSPA)** (2015–2025).
- Editorial stewardship, including **Associate Editor** responsibilities for the cybersecurity section of *Frontiers in Big Data*.
- Program committee service across cybersecurity, analytics, and formal methods venues (including RTA 2000 and RTA 2005 in term rewriting).

## College and university service
- **NSM College Policy Committee**.
- **University of Houston Faculty Senate**.
- **University Security Committee**.
- Department and lab leadership (e.g., Director of the ReDAS Laboratory; Director of Undergraduate Studies; faculty search leadership roles).

## Research-leave service substitution (clarification)
During nationally competitive, externally funded research leave (including a **Fulbright Distinguished appointment** and an **ONR-funded sabbatical**), local committee service was appropriately substituted with high-impact national and international service, maintaining institutional representation and visibility.
