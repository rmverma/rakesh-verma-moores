This site provides a concise overview of **research**, **teaching/mentorship**, and **service** impact, prepared to complement materials submitted for consideration for a Moores Professorship. The content summarizes long-term contributions and outcomes with links to representative publications and activities.

## Research Impact
My research spans **cybersecurity**, **security analytics**, **natural language processing**, and **formal methods**. Contributions include foundational results in term rewriting systems, influential work on phishing and deception detection, recent advances in adversarial text analysis, and sustained emphasis on data quality and evaluation for security analytics.

- Representative items: ESORICS 2012 (phishing/NLP), ACM CCS 2019 (data quality/security analytics), IEEE Access 2020 (phishing benchmarking), AAAI 2026 (adversarial text detection), *Cybersecurity Analytics* (CRC Press, 2019).
